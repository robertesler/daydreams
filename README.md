# Day Dreams
This is software and other, patch and other files associated with performing Day Dreams by Philippe Boesmans.  All files associated with this repository are for archival or research purposes only.

Day Dreams was originally written in 1991, the synthesized electronics, or computer portion, was created by Jean-Marc Sullon at the Centre de Recherches et de Formation Musicales de Wallonie (CRFMW) now known as the Centre Henri Pousseur.  It was performed by Wim Konik.

In 2003 I re-realized the electronics without a K & K pickup system in Max/MSP 3.  Patrick Delges from CRFMW also contributed the spatialization part of the original.  

Both versions have became unusable and essentially made this master work extinct.  

This is my attempt at keeping Day Dreams alive.
